# Openbox QuickStart Script

This Script includes a bunch of pre-configured files that will be used in the script, as well as the script itself.
This Script aims to allow users to streamline their installation of openbox on their debian (or debian-based) distribution.

## Usage
To use this repository effectively on a minimal install of debian, install the "git" package using apt and do a clone of this repository.

If you aren't sure, issue the following in your terminal:
```cli
git clone https://github.com/GilProfessor/OBQSS
```

also check [obmenu-generator](https://github.com/trizen/obmenu-generator) for a better openbox menu!
